Personal Weather Station Project

A Weather station is a device that collects data related to the weather and environment using many different sensors. We can measure many things like: 
•	Temperature 
•	Humidity 
•	Wind 
•	Barometric Pressure 
•	UV index 
•	Rain
My inspiration to create this weather station came from this source along with the code which was modified to my purpose using Arduino Nano as main board and thing speak to send data to.
